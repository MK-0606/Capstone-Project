<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<hr>
<h2>List:</h2>
<h3>1. Videogames</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I like to play videogames in my spare time. I grew up playing games on the playstion 1 and 2, eventually it led me to playstion 4. I switched from playing games on the console to playing games on PC since the processing power and image quality is far better in comparison. Playing games also helped to educate me on how to speak better english, to improve my reflex time and to better understand computer systems and components.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Music</h3>
<ul>
    <li>I love listening to music when it gets too quiet around me. I grew up listening to Trace Urban on the DSTV channel 325 and then shifted to listening music on the cellphone with earphones. I can basically listen to any music but my favorite music genre has to be Orchestral music, gives me goosebumbs everytime I hear all the instruments working in sync.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Videos/Movies</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This one should not come as a surprise but watching videos on the internet can get addicting. I like to watch funny videos from time to time, sometimes I like to watch trailers for upcomming games and series. I mostly enjoy watching documentaries on philosophies, actual history and actual discoveries.</li>
</ul>
