 <p>All my life I have had a hard time trying to achieve success, due to bullying, constant strikes that prevented any progression at colleges and due to the COVID pandemic. Regardless, I got back up and still kept trying. I have dreams and goals that I take very seriously and I won't stop until I have achieved them.</p>
 <p>I dropped out of school at the age of 16 due to bullying and depression. I dropped out of College after finishing my 1st year in the IT subject due to strikes and COVID. My chances of finding work is very low and thus led me to do IT courses at home.</p>
